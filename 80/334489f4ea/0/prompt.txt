Implement the following plan:

# Add `-d` short argument for diff mode

## Context
Currently, diff mode is only enabled via `--diff`. The user wants `-d` as a short alias.

## Change
**File:** `src/main.rs:20`

Add `short = 'd'` to the `#[arg]` attribute:

```rust
#[arg(short = 'd', long, value_names = ["BASELINE", "MODIFIED"], num_args = 2)]
```

This enables `dcr -d baseline.dcm modified.dcm` as equivalent to `dcr --diff baseline.dcm modified.dcm`.

## Verification
- `cargo build`
- `dcr --help` should show `-d` alongside `--diff`
- `dcr -d file1.dcm file2.dcm` should work the same as `dcr --diff file1.dcm file2.dcm`
